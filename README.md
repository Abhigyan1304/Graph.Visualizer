# PathVisualizer

PathVisualizer is a Java-based GUI application built using Swing, which allows users to visualize various graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's shortest path, and Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree.

## Features
- Visualize graph traversal using BFS and DFS.
- Visualize the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Generate the Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's algorithm.
- Add custom nodes and edges.
- Display algorithm results visually in a user-friendly interface.
